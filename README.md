# Expo Linking.addEventListener Inconsistency on Android Background

This repository demonstrates a bug related to Expo's `Linking.addEventListener` function not firing consistently on Android when the app is in the background.  Deep links are not processed reliably, which can significantly impact app functionality.

## Bug Description
The `Linking.addEventListener` function, intended to listen for incoming deep links, does not always trigger when a deep link is opened, particularly if the app is already running in the background on Android. This non-deterministic behavior makes debugging challenging.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app on an Android device or emulator.
3. Send a deep link to the app while it's in the background.
4. Observe that the `Linking.addEventListener` callback might not be invoked consistently, resulting in the app failing to handle the deep link. 

## Solution
The provided solution involves several strategies to improve the reliability of deep link handling.  It involves using a combination of techniques to ensure the event listener works reliably under various conditions.
