This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` function might not always trigger when a deep link is opened, especially if the app is already running in the background. This can lead to unexpected behavior where the app doesn't react to the deep link as expected.  The issue might be related to Android specific issues, timing problems, or incorrect setup of the app's intent filters.
